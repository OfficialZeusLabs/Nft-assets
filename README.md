> ## Overview
<p align="justify">
NFT Factory is a groundbreaking project by Zeus Labs aimed at democratizing access to financial assets by tokenizing real-world assets seamlessly on the Gnosis blockchain. This repository contains the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the NFT Factory, providing the foundation for creating and managing NFTs representing real-world assets.
</p>



#
> ## Core Features Implemented

`Deployment on Gnosis chain`
- Deployment on Gnosis chain.


- data base for storage purpose
- Nsme create the nfts
- end users can mint
- end user can list
- end users can redeem their nft
- market place for end users


`Test Coverage`
- Unit testing ensures that all the codes meet the quality standards and the functions return the expected output.
- Test coverage shows us the extent of how much of our codes are covered by tests. We ideally aim for 100% coverage.

`Natspec commenting`
- This documentation provides information about the codebase and their implementation for both technical and non technical people.

#
> ## Technologies
| <b><u>Stack</u></b> | <b><u>Usage</u></b> |
| :------------------ | :------------------ |
| **`Solidity`**      | Smart contract      |
| **`Next JS`**      | Frontend            |

#
> ## Repo Setup

<p align="justify">
To setup the repo, first fork the Nft-assets Repo, then clone the forked repository to create a copy on the local machine.
</p>

    $ git clone https://github.com/BukiOffor/Nft-assets

<p align="justify">
Change directory to the cloned repo and set the original PrismVox.io repository as the "upstream" and your forked repository as the "origin" using gitbash.
</p>

    $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/BukiOffor/Nft-assets.git

#

> ## Requirements
#
- Hardhat
- Alchemy key
- Metamask key
- https://gnosisscan.io/ API Url
- Node JS
#
> ## Setup the Project
**`*Note:`**

<p align="justify">
This project was setup on a windows 10 system using the gitbash terminal. Some of the commands used may not work with the VScode terminal, command prompt or powershell.
</p>

The steps involved are outlined below:-
#
> ### Install Hardhat
The first step involves cloning and installing hardhat.
```shell
$ cd core

$ npm i -D hardhat

$ npm install

$ npm install --save-dev "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle" "ethereum-waffle" "chai" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers" "ethers" "web3" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-web3" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-etherscan" "@openzeppelin/contracts" "dotenv" "@tenderly/hardhat-tenderly" "hardhat-gas-reporter" "hardhat-deploy"
```
> ### Env Setup
 Next create a `.env` file by using the sample.env. Retrieve your information from the relevant sites and input the information where needed in the `.env` file.

#
`To retrieve your gnosis key.`
- Login to [gnosisscan](https://gnosisscan.io/) and hover over the dropdown arrow for your profile on the navbar.
- Click on API keys and add to create a new project (optional step).
- Once the project has been created, click on the copy button to copy the API key.
- Paste it in the .env file

</p>

#
> ## Setup the Frontend
- First run the frontend on your local server to ensure it's fully functional before building for production.
#
> ### Install Dependencies
- Setup and install dependencies

```shell
$ cd client

$ npm install

$ npm run dev
```
> ### Steps to host the live site on Vercel
- Create an account on [vercel](https://vercel.com/) and authorize your [GitHub](https://github.com/BukiOffor/Nft-assets/) account.

- Once you're redirected to the Dashboard, click on the drop down menu and select `Add GitHub Org or Account`.

- In the pop-up window, select the install option.

- Once installation is completed, return to the dashboard and click `new project`.

- Select the TeamB organization and select the zurischool repo to import the project.

- Enter the relevant details and click `Deploy`.


#
> ## Testing the Smartcontract

- Coverage is used to view the percentage of the code required by tests and unittests were implemented to ensure that the code functions as expected
#
**`Coverage Test`**
- To test the smartcontract, first open a terminal and run the following command:

- First install Solidity Coverage
```
  $ npm i solidity-coverage
```
- Add `require('solidity-coverage')` to hardhat.config.json

- Install Ganache
``` 
  $ npm i ganache-cli
``` 
- Run coverage
```
$ npx hardhat coverage --network localhost

# if you get errors and you want to trace the error in the terminal
$ npx hardhat coverage --network localhost --show-stack-traces
```
